Read the attached paper carefully. Identify its core contributions, methods, and the problem it addresses.

Then search the web to find important related work that the paper does NOT cite. Focus on:
1. Recent or concurrent publications that address the same problem or use similar methods
2. Seminal or foundational papers in the area that are conspicuously absent from the references
3. Work that proposes the same or very similar approach, which would affect the paper's novelty claims
4. Important baselines or alternative methods commonly used for this problem that are not mentioned

For each missing reference you find, explain why it is relevant and why its absence matters.

Do NOT flag works that are only tangentially related. Only include references whose absence represents a meaningful gap in the paper's related work coverage.

Return your findings in the required output format with:
1. The search queries you executed
2. The missing references you found (topic, work details, URL, relevance)
3. A summary of whether the paper has significant gaps in its related work
