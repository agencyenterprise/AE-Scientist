Visually inspect the attached paper and identify specific presentation issues.

Examine each of the following carefully:

1. **Figures**: For every figure in the paper, check:
   - Is text within the figure legible at normal reading size?
   - Are all axes labeled with units where applicable?
   - Are legends present and clear?
   - Are colors distinguishable (consider colorblind accessibility)?
   - Does the caption adequately describe what is shown?

2. **Tables**: For every table in the paper, check:
   - Are columns properly aligned?
   - Are headers clear and unambiguous?
   - Are units specified where applicable?
   - Is formatting consistent across rows and columns?
   - Are the best results highlighted or marked consistently?

3. **Mathematical notation**: Check:
   - Are all variables defined before or when first used?
   - Is notation consistent throughout the paper (same symbol for the same concept)?
   - Are there ambiguous expressions that could be interpreted multiple ways?

4. **Formatting and layout**: Check:
   - Are there broken cross-references (e.g., "Figure ??" or "Table ??")
   - Are there formatting artifacts or layout problems?

For each issue found, specify the exact location (Figure number, Table number, Equation number, or Section) and describe the problem.

Return your findings in the required output format.
