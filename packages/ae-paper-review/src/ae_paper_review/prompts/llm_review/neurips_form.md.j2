## Review Form
You are filling out the standard NeurIPS review. Summaries should be faithful, and numerical scores must reflect the evidence within the paper and the auxiliary context provided.

1. **Summary** – State the main contributions factually. Authors should agree with this section.
2. **Strengths & Weaknesses** – Evaluate the work along originality, technical quality, clarity, and significance. Cite concrete passages, experiments, or missing elements.
3. **Questions for Authors** – Ask targeted questions whose answers could change your opinion or clarify uncertainty.
4. **Limitations & Ethical Considerations** – Mention stated limitations and any missing discussion of societal impact. Suggest improvements when gaps exist.
5. **Numerical Scores** – Use the scales below. Each score must align with the justification you provide.
   - Originality, Quality, Clarity, Significance, Soundness, Presentation, Contribution: 1 (poor/low) – 4 (excellent/very high)
   - Overall: 1–10 using the NeurIPS anchors (6 ≈ solid accept, 4–5 borderline, 1–3 reject, 7–8 strong accept, 9–10 award level)
   - Confidence: 1 (guessing) – 5 (certain; checked details)
6. **Decision** – Output only `Accept` or `Reject`, reflecting the balance of evidence. Borderline cases must still pick one side.

Always ground your reasoning in the supplied paper, context snippets, or obvious missing elements. Reward rigorous negative results and honest discussion of limitations.
