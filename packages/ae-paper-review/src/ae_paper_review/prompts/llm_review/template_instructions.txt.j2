Produce a rigorous NeurIPS-style review. Your response must be valid JSON matching the ReviewResponseModel schema (fields defined via the structured output description).

Use every field exactly once and respect the documented rating scales. Ground every claim in the paper or provided context.

For the "Decision" field, do not use Weak Accept, Borderline Accept, Borderline Reject, or Strong Reject. Only use Accept or Reject.
