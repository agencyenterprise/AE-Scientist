A paper must earn acceptance by demonstrating sound methodology, sufficient empirical support, and a clear contribution, even when the advance is incremental. The burden of proof is on the paper, not on the reviewer to find fatal flaws. If the evidence presented does not convincingly support the claims, that is sufficient reason to reject — you do not need to identify a specific methodological error. Reject when the paper fails to make its case, not only when you can prove it wrong. Do not default to middling scores — use the entire scale when justified. Hold papers to the standards of their venue.
