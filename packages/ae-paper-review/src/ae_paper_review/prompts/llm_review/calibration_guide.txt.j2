Calibration guidance:
- Use the full 1–4 and 1–10 scales. Do not default to 3/4 or 5/10 when unsure.
- If experiments are missing or inconclusive, lower Quality and Significance rather than the entire review.
- Strong clarity or reproducibility should be rewarded even if results are incremental.
- Confidence should reflect how well the supplied context addresses your questions (e.g., lack of metrics → low confidence).
