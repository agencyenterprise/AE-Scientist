## Review Form (NeurIPS 2025)
Below is a description of the questions you will be asked on the review form for each paper and some guidelines on what to consider when answering these questions.
When writing your review, please keep in mind that after decisions have been made, reviews and meta-reviews of accepted papers and opted-in rejected papers will be made public.

1. **Summary**: Briefly summarize the paper and its contributions. This is not the place to critique the paper; the authors should generally agree with a well-written summary. This is also not the place to paste the abstract—please provide the summary in your own understanding after reading.

2. **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. A good mental framing for strengths and weaknesses is to think of reasons you might accept or reject the paper. Please touch on the following dimensions:
   - **Quality**: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported (e.g., by theoretical analysis or experimental results)? Are the methods used appropriate? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?
   - **Clarity**: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note that a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.) Visually inspect figures, tables, and mathematical notation: are figures legible with clear labels and captions? Are tables well-aligned and consistently formatted? Is mathematical notation correct, consistent, and unambiguous?
   - **Significance**: Are the results impactful for the community? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance our understanding/knowledge on the topic in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?
   - **Originality**: Does the work provide new insights, deepen understanding, or highlight important properties of existing methods? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions, with relevant citations provided? Does the work introduce novel tasks or methods that advance the field? Does this work offer a novel combination of existing techniques, and is the reasoning behind this combination well-articulated? Originality does not necessarily require introducing an entirely new method. A work that provides novel insights by evaluating existing methods, or demonstrates improved efficiency, fairness, etc. is also equally valuable.

3. **Questions**: Please list up and carefully describe questions and suggestions for the authors, which should focus on key points (ideally around 3–5) that are actionable with clear guidance. Think of the things where a response from the author can change your opinion, clarify a confusion or address a limitation. You are strongly encouraged to state the clear criteria under which your evaluation score could increase or decrease. This can be very important for a productive rebuttal and discussion phase with the authors.

4. **Limitations**: Have the authors adequately addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work? If so, simply leave 'yes'; if not, please include constructive suggestions for improvement. In general, authors should be rewarded rather than punished for being up front about the limitations of their work and any potential negative societal impact. You are encouraged to think through whether any critical points are missing and provide these as feedback for the authors.

5. **Ethical Concerns**: If there are ethical issues with this paper, please flag the paper for an ethics review and explain the specific concerns.

6. **Quality**: Based on what you discussed in 'Strengths and Weaknesses', please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the quality of the work.
   - 4: excellent
   - 3: good
   - 2: fair
   - 1: poor

7. **Clarity**: Based on what you discussed in 'Strengths and Weaknesses', please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the clarity of the paper.
   - 4: excellent
   - 3: good
   - 2: fair
   - 1: poor

8. **Significance**: Based on what you discussed in 'Strengths and Weaknesses', please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the significance of the paper.
   - 4: excellent
   - 3: good
   - 2: fair
   - 1: poor

9. **Originality**: Based on what you discussed in 'Strengths and Weaknesses', please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the originality of the paper.
   - 4: excellent
   - 3: good
   - 2: fair
   - 1: poor

10. **Overall**: Please provide an "overall score" for this submission. Choices:
    - 6: Strong Accept: Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking impact on one or more areas of AI, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility, and resources, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
    - 5: Accept: Technically solid paper, with high impact on at least one sub-area of AI or moderate-to-high impact on more than one area of AI, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
    - 4: Borderline accept: Technically solid paper where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Please use sparingly.
    - 3: Borderline reject: Technically solid paper where reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept, e.g., good evaluation. Please use sparingly.
    - 2: Reject: For instance, a paper with technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility and incompletely addressed ethical considerations.
    - 1: Strong Reject: For instance, a paper with well-known results or unaddressed ethical considerations.

11. **Confidence**: Please provide a "confidence score" for your assessment of this submission to indicate how confident you are in your evaluation. Choices:
    - 5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.
    - 4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.
    - 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.
    - 2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.
    - 1: Your assessment is an educated guess. The submission is not in your area or the submission was difficult to understand. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

12. **Decision**: Output only `Accept` or `Reject`. Borderline cases must pick one side.
