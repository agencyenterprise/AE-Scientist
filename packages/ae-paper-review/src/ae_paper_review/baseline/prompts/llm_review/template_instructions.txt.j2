Produce a rigorous review following the conference format above. Your response must be valid JSON matching the schema (fields defined via the structured output description).

Use every field exactly once and respect the documented rating scales. Ground every claim in the paper or provided context.

For the "Decision" field, do not use Weak Accept, Borderline Accept, Borderline Reject, or Strong Reject. Only use Accept or Reject. The Decision must be consistent with your Overall score: scores at or below the acceptance threshold should map to Reject, and scores above it should map to Accept.
