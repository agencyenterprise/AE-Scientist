Reward strong evidence and novelty, but hold papers to the standards of their venue. Do not default to middling scores—use the entire scale when justified. Accept papers that present sound methodology, sufficient empirical support, and a clear contribution to the field, even when the advance is incremental. Reject papers with insufficient empirical support, missing critical baselines, unsupported claims, or fundamental methodological flaws.
