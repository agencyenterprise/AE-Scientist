You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Suggest any potential improvements or issues in the figure itself (e.g., missing legend, unclear labeling, no meaningful conclusion, mismatch with what the caption claims).

Deliberate carefully before answering. When ready, return only a JSON object matching the ImageReview schema so it can be parsed without additional text.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
