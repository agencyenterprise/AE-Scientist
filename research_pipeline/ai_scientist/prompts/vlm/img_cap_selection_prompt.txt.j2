The abstract of the paper is:

You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.
  3. Critically analyze whether the image content aligns with the given caption:

{{ caption }}

  4. We also have references in the main text that mention the figure:

{{ main_text_figrefs }}

  5. We have limited pages to present contents:

{{ reflection_page_info }}

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Critique the caption: does it accurately describe the figure? Is it too long/short? Does it include a concise takeaway?
  - Review how well the main text references (figrefs) explain the figure: are they missing? Do they adequately describe the figure's content, context, or purpose?

After considering all of the above, you should carefully evaluate:
  - Given the current page limit, does this image and its relevant text add significant value to the paper's scientific argument?
  - Given the current page limit, is this image too sparse in information? Should it be combined with other figures in the main text?
  - Does this figure contain subfigures?
  - Is this figure not very informative? For example, some figures may show bars with very similar heights that are difficult to distinguish, or present data in a way that does not effectively communicate meaningful differences or patterns.

Think step-by-step about these considerations, then respond with a JSON object matching the ImageSelectionReview schema. Provide strictly the JSON (no extra commentary) so it can be parsed automatically.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
