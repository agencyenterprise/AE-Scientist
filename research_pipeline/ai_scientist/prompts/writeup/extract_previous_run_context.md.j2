# Extract Context from Previous Research Run

You are analyzing a **previous research run** to extract information useful for writing a paper about the **current research run**.

## Your Task

Extract relevant findings from the previous run and create a markdown summary that will help the paper-writing LLM understand:
1. What was accomplished in the previous run
2. Key experimental results and metrics
3. How the current run builds upon or differs from the previous work
4. Any baseline comparisons that would be useful for the paper

## Current Research Context

### Current Research Idea
{{ current_idea_text }}

### Current Experiment Summaries
{{ current_summaries }}

## Previous Run Data Location

The previous run artifacts are located at: `{{ previous_run_path }}`

This directory contains downloaded artifacts from the parent research run. Explore it to discover what's available.

## Analysis Priorities

**Focus on these artifacts** (if available):
1. **Previous paper PDF** (`paper_pdf/*.pdf`) - Read the entire paper to understand methods, results, and conclusions
2. **LaTeX source** (`latex_archive/*.zip`) - Extract the LaTeX files to understand structure and content details
3. **Plots** (`plot/*.png`) - Examine figures to understand experimental results
4. **Review data** (`llm_review/*.json`) - Check if there are any review comments or feedback

**You may also explore**:
- Workspace archive for additional code/data insights
- Run logs for execution details

## Instructions

1. **Explore the previous run directory**: List and examine available files
2. **Read the previous paper** (if PDF exists): Focus on abstract, methods, results, and conclusions
3. **Extract LaTeX** (if archive exists): Unzip and read key sections
4. **Analyze plots**: Understand what experiments were visualized
5. **Summarize findings**: Create a concise markdown summary

## Output Requirements

Write your findings to: `/workspace/previous_run_context.md`

### Expected Output Format

```markdown
# Previous Run Context

## Summary
[Brief overview of what the previous run accomplished]

## Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

## Experimental Results
[Summarize main results, metrics, performance numbers]

## Methodology Highlights
[Key aspects of the previous approach]

## Relevance to Current Run
[How the current research builds upon or differs from the previous work]

## Suggested Integration
[Recommendations for how to incorporate this context into the current paper]
```

## Important Notes

- **CRITICAL: This is a fully automated run.** You are running in non-interactive mode. Do NOT ask the user for input, feedback, or confirmation. Proceed autonomously with reasonable defaults.
- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on information that would be valuable for paper writing
- If certain artifacts are missing or unreadable, note this in your summary
- If no useful previous run data is found, write a brief note explaining why
- You have full access to the filesystem and can use any tools needed (unzip, pdftotext, etc.)
