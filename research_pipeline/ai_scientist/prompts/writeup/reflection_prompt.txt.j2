Now let's reflect and identify issues (including but not limited to):
1) LaTeX syntax errors or style violations? Use chktex output below.
2) Is the writing clear and scientifically rigorous?
3) Have we included all relevant details from the summaries without hallucinating?
4) Figures available but not used: {{ unused_figs }}
5) Figure references with no backing files: {{ invalid_figs }}
{{ reflection_page_info }}
chktex results:
```
{{ check_output }}
```
VLM caption/reference review:
```
{{ review_img_cap_ref }}
```
Duplicate figure analysis:
```
{{ analysis_duplicate_figs }}
```

Respond using the structured schema (latex_code, should_stop). Set should_stop=true only if no revisions are necessary.
