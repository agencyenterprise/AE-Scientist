# Refine Research Paper Based on Review Feedback

You are refining a research paper based on automated review feedback.

**CRITICAL: This is a fully automated run.** You are running in non-interactive mode. Do NOT ask the user for input, feedback, or confirmation. Proceed autonomously with reasonable defaults.

## Current Paper Location

The paper LaTeX source is at: `{{ latex_folder }}/template.tex`
The current compiled PDF is at: `{{ current_pdf_path }}`

## Review Feedback

### Page Count Information
{{ page_info }}

### Figure Usage Analysis

**Figures referenced in paper**: {{ used_figures }}
**Available figures NOT used**: {{ unused_figures }}
**Invalid figure references (files don't exist)**: {{ invalid_figures }}

### chktex Warnings

```
{{ chktex_output }}
```

### VLM Figure/Caption Review

The following is an automated review of each figure's quality, caption accuracy, and how well it's referenced in the text:

```
{{ vlm_caption_review }}
```

### Duplicate Figure Analysis

```
{{ vlm_duplicate_analysis }}
```

{% if vlm_selection_review %}
### Figure Selection Review

Analysis of whether each figure adds sufficient value given page limits:

```
{{ vlm_selection_review }}
```
{% endif %}

## Your Task

1. **Read the current paper**: Review `{{ latex_folder }}/template.tex`
2. **Address the feedback**:
   - Fix any chktex warnings
   - Improve figure captions based on VLM review
   - Better integrate figure references into the text
   - Remove or consolidate duplicate/redundant figures
   - Consider adding unused figures if they provide value
   - Remove invalid figure references
   - Adjust content to meet page limit if needed
3. **Recompile**: Run `cd {{ latex_folder }} && pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode template.tex && bibtex template && pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode template.tex && pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode template.tex`
4. **Verify**: Ensure the paper compiles without errors

## Guidelines

- Maintain scientific accuracy and objectivity
- Do not remove important content just to meet page limits - consider moving to appendix
- Ensure all figure references are valid
- Improve caption quality to be self-contained and informative
- Make sure figures are discussed meaningfully in the text

## Output

The refined paper should be saved to `{{ latex_folder }}/template.tex` and compiled to `{{ latex_folder }}/template.pdf`.
