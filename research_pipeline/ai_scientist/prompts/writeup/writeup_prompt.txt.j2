Your goal is to write up the following idea:

```markdown
{{ idea_text }}
```

{% if previous_run_context %}
## Context from Previous Research Run

This research builds upon a previous run. The following context has been extracted from that run:

```markdown
{{ previous_run_context }}
```

**Important**: Please incorporate these findings appropriately when writing the paper:
- Reference previous results as baselines or prior work where relevant
- Highlight how the current approach improves upon or differs from the previous work
- Maintain continuity in the research narrative
- You may cite the previous work in the Related Work section or throughout the paper as appropriate
- Use the previous findings to provide context for the current experiments and results

We have the following experiment summaries (JSON):
```json
{{ summaries }}
```

We also have a script used to produce the final plots (use this to see how the plots are generated and what names are used in the legend):
```python
{{ aggregator_code }}
```
Please also consider which plots should naturally be grouped together as subfigures.

Available plots for the writeup (use these filenames):
```
{{ plot_list }}
```

We also have VLM-based figure descriptions:
```
{{ plot_descriptions }}
```

Your current progress on the LaTeX write-up is:
```latex
{{ latex_writeup }}
```

Produce the final version of the LaTeX manuscript now, ensuring the paper is coherent, concise, and reports results accurately.
Return the entire file in full, with no unfilled placeholders!
This must be an acceptable complete LaTeX writeup.
Use the structured response schema (fields: latex_code, should_stop). Set should_stop=true only if no edits are required.
