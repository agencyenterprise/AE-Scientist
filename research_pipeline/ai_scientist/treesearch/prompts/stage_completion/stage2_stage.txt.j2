Evaluate if Stage 2 (baseline tuning) is complete based on the following evidence:

1. Datasets Tested: {{ datasets_successfully_tested }}

Requirements for completion:
1. Training dynamics (metrics/loss curves) should show stable convergence
2. Results should be tested on at least two datasets
3. There should be no clear signs of training instabilities or divergence in the reported metrics

Provide a detailed evaluation of completion status.
