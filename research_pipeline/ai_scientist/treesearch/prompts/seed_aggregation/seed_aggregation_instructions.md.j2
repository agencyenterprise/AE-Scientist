## Seed aggregation task (multi-seed roll-up)
- The JSON context in `codex_task.md` includes a `seed_aggregation` object describing seed runs.
- Your job is to aggregate results across seeds and produce a rolled-up report + plots.
- Load each seed run's `experiment_data.npy` from the provided `exp_results_dir` paths when available.
- Compute mean ± std/sem across seeds where applicable and produce summary plots (error bars, aggregated curves).
- Save aggregated results into `./working/experiment_data.npy` so a separate metrics-parsing pass can compute final/best metric values.
- Write plots as `.png` files into `./working/`.
- Set `is_seed_node=true` and `is_seed_agg_node=true` in `node_result.json`.
- Set `is_buggy=false` and `is_buggy_plots=false` if aggregation succeeded and plots were produced.
