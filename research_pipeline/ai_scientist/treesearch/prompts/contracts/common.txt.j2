## Node result contract (STRICT; enforced by the harness)
- You MUST include the following keys in `node_result.json` with the exact types:
  - `plan`: string (non-empty)
  - `is_buggy_plots`: boolean (true/false; never null)
  - `datasets_successfully_tested`: list of strings (can be empty)
  - `is_seed_agg_node`: boolean (false for normal runs; true only for seed aggregation runs)
- Do not add extra top-level keys to `node_result.json` beyond the Node schema; unexpected keys are treated as contract violations.
