You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.
  3. Critically analyze whether the image content aligns with the given caption:

{{ caption }}

  4. We also have references in the main text that mention the figure:

{{ main_text_figrefs }}

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Suggest any potential improvements or issues in the figure itself (e.g., missing legend, unclear labeling, no meaningful conclusion, mismatch with what the caption claims).
  - Critique the caption: does it accurately describe the figure? Is it too long/short? Does it include a concise takeaway?
  - Review how well the main text references (figrefs) explain the figure: are they missing? Do they adequately describe the figure's content, context, or purpose?

Reason carefully through these observations before replying. Only after finishing your internal reasoning should you respond with a JSON object matching the ImageCaptionRefReview schema. Do not include any additional prose around the JSON; ensure it is valid and properly formatted for automatic parsing.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
