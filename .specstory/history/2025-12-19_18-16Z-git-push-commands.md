### Push your local branch to the remote branch

- **First time pushing this local branch (set upstream):**

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

- **After that (normal push):**

```bash
git push
```

- **If you want to be explicit about branch names:**

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>   # first time
git push origin <your-branch-name>      # subsequent pushes
```

- **Check what branch you’re on / what it tracks:**

```bash
git status -sb
git branch -vv
```
